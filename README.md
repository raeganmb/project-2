# Wet Your Plants: Full Stack Application - Project 2

A plant-loving community forum for questions and tips and tricks for all things that grow!


###About the project

This full stack application is a forum-style community for plant-lovers!  

After logging in with your Google account, you will have access to create posts and start discussions about plant problems or ask for tips and tricks.  Other users will be able to comment on your posts to give feedback!

First, start by logging in on the home page:

Then you will have access to see previously created posts:

And even create a post of your own:
